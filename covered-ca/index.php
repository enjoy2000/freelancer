            <p>Whether you are single, married, a student, young professional, low-income, unemployed or even have a preexisting
                condition, you can qualify for heath insurance through Covered California.</p>

            <p><strong>Nobody is turned away.</strong> Assistance is based on a sliding scale with your income. The less you make, the more help you
                can receive, but you need to act now. Open enrollment runs until February 15th. If you donâ€™t enroll, you may be 
                subject to financial penalties.</p>

            <p><strong>Questions? Need some additional help?</strong><br />
